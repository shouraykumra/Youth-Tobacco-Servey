1999-2017. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System. YTS Data. The YTS was developed to provide states with comprehensive data on both middle school and high school students regarding tobacco use, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, smoking cessation, school curriculum, minors' ability to purchase or otherwise obtain tobacco products, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco, and familiarity with pro-tobacco and anti-tobacco media messages. The YTS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in middle schools (grades 6–8) and high schools (grades 9–12). The data for the STATE System were extracted from Youth Tobacco Surveys from participating states. Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking frequency, smokeless tobacco products prevalence and quit attempts.


What data depicts?

The data tells us the popularity of cessation, cigarette and smokeless tabacco among high school and middle school students. The data also shows attempts to quit smoking and who are eager to quit divided between men, women and overall. The data shows information according to the states which gives us the clear evaluation of which state is more affected with these activities.
